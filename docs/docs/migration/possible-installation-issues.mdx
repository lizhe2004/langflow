# Possible Installation Issues

This is a list of possible issues that you may encounter when installing Langflow 1.0 Alpha and how to solve them.

## _`No module named 'langflow.__main__'`_

TLDR;

- Run _`python -m langflow run`_ instead of _`langflow run`_. If that doesn't work, run _`_python -m pip install langflow --pre -U`_ to reinstall langflow.
- If the above doesn't work, run _`python -m pip install langflow --pre -U --force-reinstall`_ to reinstall langflow and its dependencies.

When you try to run langflow using the command `langflow run`, you may encounter the following error:

```bash
> langflow run
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File ".../langflow", line 5, in <module>
  from langflow.__main__ import main
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langflow.__main__'
```

For this error to occur, two scenarios are possible:

1. You've installed langflow using _`pip install langflow`_ but you already had a previous version of langflow installed in your system.
   In this case, you might not be running the correct executable.
   To solve this issue, you can run the correct executable by running _`python -m langflow run`_ instead of _`langflow run`_ and if that doesn't work, you can try uninstalling langflow and reinstalling it using _`python -m pip install langflow --pre -U`_.
2. Some version conflicts might have occurred during the installation process. Run _`python -m pip install langflow --pre -U --force-reinstall`_ to reinstall langflow and its dependencies.
