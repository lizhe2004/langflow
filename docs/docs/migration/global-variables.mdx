# Global Variables

## TLDR;

- Global Variables are reusable variables that can be accessed from any Text field in your project.
- To create a Global Variable, click on the üåê button in a Text field and then **+ Add New Variable**.
- Define the **Name**, **Type**, and **Value** of the variable.
- Click on **Save Variable** to create the variable.
- All Credential Global Variables are encrypted and cannot be accessed by anyone but you.
- Set _`LANGFLOW_STORE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES`_ to _`true`_ in your `.env` file to add all variables in _`LANGFLOW_VARIABLES_TO_GET_FROM_ENVIRONMENT`_ to your user's Global Variables.

Global Variables are a really useful feature of Langflow.
They allow you to define reusable variables that can be accessed from any Text field in your project.

The first thing you need to do is find a **Text field** in a Component, so let's talk about what a Text field is.

## Text Fields

Text fields are the fields in a Component where you can write text but that does not allow you to open a Text Area.

The easiest way to find fields that are Text fields, though, is to look for fields that have a üåê button.

    light: "img/ollama-gv.png",
    dark: "img/ollama-gv.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

## Creating a Global Variable

To create a Global Variable, you need to click on the üåê button in a Text field and that will open a dropdown showing your currently available variables and at the end of it **+ Add New Variable**.

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: "img/add-new-variable.png",
    dark: "img/add-new-variable.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "60%" }}
/>

Click on **+ Add New Variable** and a window will open where you can define your new Global Variable.

In it, you can define the **Name** of the variable, the optional **Type** of the variable, and the **Value** of the variable.

The **Name** is the name that you will use to refer to the variable in your Text fields.

The **Type** is optional for now but will be used in the future to allow for more advanced features.

The **Value** is the value that the variable will have.

  sources={{
    light: "img/create-variable-window.png",
    dark: "img/create-variable-window.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "60%" }}
/>

After you have defined your variable, click on **Save Variable** and your variable will be created.

After that, once you click on the üåê button in a Text field, you will see your new variable in the dropdown.

## Environment Variables

If you set _`LANGFLOW_STORE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES`_ to _`true`_ (which is the default value) in your `.env` file, all variables in _`LANGFLOW_VARIABLES_TO_GET_FROM_ENVIRONMENT`_ will be added to your user's Global Variables.

All of these variables can be used in your project as any other Global Variable.

<Admonition type="tip">
  You can set _`LANGFLOW_STORE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES`_ to _`false`_ in your
  `.env` file to prevent this behavior.
</Admonition>

You can also set _`LANGFLOW_VARIABLES_TO_GET_FROM_ENVIRONMENT`_ to a list of variables that you want to get from the environment.

The default list at the moment is:

- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT
- ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN
- AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY
- AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
- AZURE_OPENAI_API_EMBEDDINGS_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
- AZURE_OPENAI_API_INSTANCE_NAME
- AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION
- COHERE_API_KEY
- GOOGLE_API_KEY
- HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- SEARCHAPI_API_KEY
- SERPAPI_API_KEY
- VECTARA_CUSTOMER_ID
- VECTARA_CORPUS_ID
- VECTARA_API_KEY

<Admonition type="tip">
  Set _`LANGFLOW_VARIABLES_TO_GET_FROM_ENVIRONMENT`_ as a comma-separated list
  of variables (e.g. _`"VARIABLE1, VARIABLE2"`_) or as a JSON-encoded string
  (e.g. _`'["VARIABLE1", "VARIABLE2"]'`_).
