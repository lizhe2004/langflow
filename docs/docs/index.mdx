## üöÄ First steps

## Installation

Make sure you have **Python 3.10** installed on your system.

You can install **Langflow** with [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/) or with pip.

Pipx can fetch the missing Python version for you, but you can also install it manually.

```bash
# Remember to check if you have Python 3.10 installed
python -m pip install langflow -U
# or
pipx install langflow --python python3.10 --fetch-missing-python
```

Or you can install a pre-release version using:

```bash
python -m pip install langflow --pre --force-reinstall
# or
pipx install langflow --python python3.10 --fetch-missing-python --pip-args="--pre --force-reinstall"
```

<Admonition type="tip">
  <p>
    Please, check out our [Possible Installation Issues
    section](/migration/possible-installation-issues) if you encounter any
    problems.
  </p>

We recommend using --force-reinstall to ensure you have the latest version of Langflow and its dependencies.

### ‚õìÔ∏è Running Langflow

Langflow can be run in a variety of ways, including using the command-line interface (CLI) or HuggingFace Spaces.

```bash
python -m langflow run # or langflow --help
```

#### ü§ó HuggingFace Spaces

Hugging Face provides a great alternative for running Langflow in their Spaces environment. This means you can run Langflow without any local installation required.

The first step is to go to the [Langflow Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Langflow/Langflow?duplicate=true) or [Langflow 1.0 Preview Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Langflow/Langflow-Preview?duplicate=true)

Remember to use a Chromium-based browser for the best experience. You'll be presented with the following screen:

<ZoomableImage

  sources={{
    light: "img/duplicate-space.png",
    dark: "img/duplicate-space.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "100%", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

From here, just name your Space, define the visibility (Public or Private), and click on `Duplicate Space` to start the installation process. When that is done, you'll be redirected to the Space's main page to start using Langflow right away!

Once you get Langflow running, click on New Project in the top right corner of the screen. Langflow provides a range of example flows to help you get started.

To quickly try one of them, open a starter example, set up your API keys and click ‚ö° Run, on the bottom right corner of the canvas. This will open up Langflow's Interaction Panel with the chat console, text inputs, and outputs.

### üñ•Ô∏è Command Line Interface (CLI)

Langflow provides a command-line interface (CLI) for easy management and configuration.

#### Usage

You can run the Langflow using the following command:

```bash
langflow run [OPTIONS]
```

Find more information about the available options by running:

```bash
python -m langflow --help
```
