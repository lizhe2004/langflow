### Import and Export

Flows can be exported and imported as JSON files.

Watch out for API keys being stored in local files.

### Code

The Code button shows snippets to use your flow as a Python object or an API.

**Python Code**

Through the Langflow package, you can run your flow from a JSON file. The example below shows how to run a flow from a JSON file.

```python
from langflow.load import run_flow_from_json

results = run_flow_from_json("path/to/flow.json", input_value="Hello, World!")
```

**API**

Once you save a flow, the API endpoint is created with your latest changes. Click the "code" button to use that flow as an API. You can post-adjust component parameters using the global variable TWEAKS.

The example below shows a Python script making a POST request to a local API endpoint, which gets a prediction based on the message input.
